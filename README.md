# The MICO Project

## **What is it?**

MICO is a project that aims to be a very dumbed-down LLVM alternative. It is still _very much_ a work-in-progress.

## **Motivation**

LLVM is... huge. Very. LLVM's Github repository is almost at 10 million lines of code and it takes hours to compile the entire thing. Since LLVM is so big, compiled binaries are known to have big file sizes. Plus, it takes a very long time to learn LLVM. So... what is your other option? Well, you have really only two. Either hand-roll your own compiler or use an LLVM alternative. The MICO project aims to be a decently fast, well-documented, and, most importantly, small optimizing compiler backend.

## **Should I use it?**

No. Absolutely not. Yet. It will probably be many years before this project would be "ready" to use.
